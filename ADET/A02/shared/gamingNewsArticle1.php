                Fans of the anime-inspired football game Azure Latch can grab a head start this April with a set of
                fresh Roblox codes offering 10,000 in-game cash each. Working codes include RINRELEASE, sorryfordelay,
                and AMMISTHEOWNERNOTLEFTRIGHTTH, which players can redeem via the in-game Rewards menu. Be sure to copy
                the codes exactly to avoid issues, as they are case-sensitive and may expire quickly. To redeem, players
                must first join the game group on Roblox and access the Rewards tab through the Menu.

                Bikini Bottom is under siege, and in SpongeBob Tower Defense, you'll need more than jellyfish nets to
                fend off the chaos. New codes like AChallenge2Open and FUNonaTuesday grant players challenge crates,
                gems, and Magic Conches to summon rare units. Just be sure you’ve reached level 10 to access the code
                box, located under the clam icon. As always, expired codes won’t work, and copy-pasting without spaces
                is key. You can stay updated by checking the official Krabby Krew Discord or revisiting the article for
                daily updates.

                If basketball is more your style, Basketball: Zero has you covered with April’s active codes such as
                100KINTERESTED and SRRYFORCRASH, offering Lucky Spins and Style Spins to upgrade your gameplay.
                Redeeming them is simple—just join the Roblox group, open the game, and enter your codes via the purple
                gift box icon. With flashy animations, fast-paced 5v5 matches, and new unlockable styles, these bonuses
                can give you an edge over the competition.

                Finally, Attack on Titan Revolution fans can gear up with extra Spins and Luck Potions thanks to new
                codes released this month. Whether you're preparing to take down Titans or simply looking to boost your
                gear and performance, these codes deliver useful items to enhance your strategy. As with the others,
                checking back frequently or joining the Discord community can keep you looped in for future releases,
                ensuring you're always equipped for battle.
