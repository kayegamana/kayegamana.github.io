                Nintendo fans hoping for a complete package with the upcoming release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of
                the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition may be in for a surprise, as the re-release won’t include the
                Expansion Pass DLC. Instead, players will need to pay an additional $20 for the downloadable content if
                they haven’t already purchased it on the original Switch. While current owners of the game and its DLC
                will be able to transfer their access to the Switch 2, newcomers will find themselves shelling out a
                total of $90 for the enhanced experience, which includes a $70 price tag for the upgraded game and
                another $20 for the DLC. The announcement has added to the growing uncertainty around pricing for
                Nintendo’s next-gen offerings, with some players criticizing the cost structure for an eight-year-old
                title.

                In more positive news, Super Mario Party Jamboree is seeing a notable discount ahead of its Nintendo
                Switch 2 Edition release. While the upcoming version is expected to retail for $79.99, consumers can
                currently grab a copy for the Nintendo Switch at just $44.99 from Woot. This comes as part of a broader
                wave of weekend deals, including 55% off the 4K Middle-Earth 6-Film Collection and a $400 markdown on
                the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop. Other highlights include Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney
                Trilogy now selling for $34.39, and The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II Deluxe Edition
                available for $50.39. As players consider where to allocate their funds ahead of the Switch 2’s launch,
                these deals provide welcome relief amid rising game prices.

                Meanwhile, Fortnite’s reign atop the battle royale genre remains firm despite a noticeable dip in
                overall interest in the genre. A new report from market research firm Newzoo revealed that battle royale
                playtime has dropped from 19% in 2021 to 12% in 2024, signaling a decline in the genre’s dominance.
                However, Fortnite has capitalized on this shift, growing its share of the genre from 43% to an
                impressive 77%. Shooter games as a whole remain strong, while role-playing games are also on the rise,
                now accounting for 13% of total playtime. Titles like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Starfield continue to lead the
                charge, showing that while genres shift, standout games still manage to captivate audiences across
                platforms.

                As Nintendo navigates a pivotal transition period with its next-generation console, the company finds
                itself balancing nostalgia and innovation with growing scrutiny over its pricing strategies. The Switch
                2 promises enhanced visuals, new features like achievements and Zelda Notes, and cross-platform
                continuity for loyal fans. Yet, the financial barrier to entry—especially for iconic titles like Breath
                of the Wild—raises questions about accessibility and value for new players. Whether bundled DLCs and
                discounts become more commonplace in the coming months remains to be seen, but one thing is certain:
                Nintendo’s every move is being closely watched by its passionate global community.
